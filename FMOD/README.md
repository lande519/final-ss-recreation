# Info
Hey!, 
this Recreation uses the [SS Fmod Fun](https://github.com/Emil2010/Sugary-Spire-Fmod-Fun) or that "Sugary Spire Fmod Recreation" Repo as a base, 
but neither of those were finished, 
So Calebiwe2027 (yes, the chuliso guy.) decided to finish it instead.
Also, i only saved the project name to something else than just "ss fmod fun two" or Whatever so please dont mind.
# Requirements 
You need [FMOD Studio 2.02](https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodstudio) to use the FMOD Project/Recreation.
#  Here's the credits!
Credits to,
Emil2010 for making the Original Fmod recreation/Repo.
and, 
Calebiwe2027 (aka chuliso guy) for finishing up the Recreation itself.
